PCDS Devices
############

Ophyd presents a uniform set of abstractions for EPICS devices. While many
devices can be represented as generic ``EpicsMotor`` and ``AreaDetector``
objects, quite a few devices are specific to LCLS. This repository holds all of
these unique devices as well as additional tools to help aid the creation of
custom devices for specific applications.
